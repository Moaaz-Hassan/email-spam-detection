# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates **spam detection system** using **Logistic Regression**. The model classifies text messages into either **"spam"** or **"ham"**.

## Model Overview

- **Model**: Logistic Regression  
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF  
- **Accuracy**: 99% on validation data
- The model achieved 99.3% accuracy, with a strong balance between precision (99.26%) and recall (97.81%), making it highly effective for spam detection.
- 
A full **pipeline** was created that combines **data preprocessing** (TF-IDF vectorization) with the **machine learning model**, making it easy to train and predict with new data.
